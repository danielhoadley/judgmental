<h1>We'll be back soon</h1>
<p>We have received a libel threat for making an unedited court judgment, a document of public record, available to the public.</p>
<p>We are working with our hosting providers to have the matter resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you want to keep up to date with what's going on, or think you could help us out, you can get in touch via <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/judgmental/"target="_blank">the mailing list</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/judgmentals" target="_blank">Tweeting @Judgmentals</a>.</p>
<p>In the mean time, you can find every judgment hosted on this website and many more on <a href="http://www.bailii.org">the BAILII website</a>, which is also free and open to the public.</p>
<p>We remain committed to enabling and promoting the study of UK law by making a comprehensive archive of material available to the public for easy access and use.</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience! Watch this space!</p>
