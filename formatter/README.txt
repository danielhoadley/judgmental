A tour of files in this directory:
----------------------------------

run.py
  Command-line tool for converting files; runs analyse.py, crossreference.py and convert.py
  (Options are described in its docstring.)

analyse.py
  Phase 1: extracts metadata from files

crossreference.py
  Phase 2: searches files for crossreferences

convert.py
  Phase 3: generates neatly-formatted output

index.py
  Generates the indexes

general.py
  Some utility code common to the three phases

prefixtree.py
  Code used in the crossreferencing phase for searching the repository for many strings simultaneously. Until Python gets a regular expression library that isn't intolerably awful, things like this are necessary.

dammit.py
  Some code for handling badly encoded files

fakepool.py
  Code that simulates multiprocessing in environments that don't support it; this avoids unnecessary code duplication.

template.html
  The HTML template for output files.



A tour of key other places:
---------------------------

../../judgmental.db
  The database file. The "analyse" phase demands that this not exist already. The "crossreference" and "convert" phases demand that it exist and that it contain the relevant data generated by the previous stages.

../../errors.log
  Important messages about files and counts are written here. This is overwritten on every run.

../../public_html/judgments/
  Output html files are written to this directory.

../styling/
  Reference copies of the CSS and associated files are stored here.

../../public_html/css/
  The working copies of CSS and associated files are expected to be found here.
