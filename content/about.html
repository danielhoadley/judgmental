<p><strong>But is our justice open <em>enough</em>? We think we need to
do better.</strong></p>

<p>It is a simple truth that to be able to obey the law, you have to be able
to find out what it is. That is, the law, <em>all</em> of the law, must be
publicly accessible.</p>

<p>In the UK we have a &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law"
target="_blank">common law</a>&quot; legal system, which means that in addition
to the law as laid down by Parliament some court decisions actually become
part of our law, since we want later decisions to be consistent with
previous ones.</p>

<p> Even where they don't directly make a ruling on an issue, decisions
of more senior courts are often very helpful in clarifying the law. Judges
often refer to the persuasiveness of points of discussion from past
judgments, so researching previous judgments which touch upon controversial
areas of law can be helpful in predicting how a court might deal with those
issues in future.</p>

<p><strong>This means that access to courts' judgments is essential for a
full understanding of our laws.</strong></p>

<p>In the past, to make something &quot;public knowledge&quot;, it was
sufficient to have the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_crier" target="_blank">town crier
</a> make an announcement. Later, in order for information to be publicly
accesible it became expected that it should be available in a local library
or published in widely-circulated national newspapers, or announced on
television. But times have moved on again.</p>

<p><strong>Today, public information cannot reasonably be called
&quot;accessible&quot; unless it is freely available online.</strong></p>

<p>While some court judgments are available via 
<a href="http://www.bailii.org.uk" target="_blank">BAILII</a>, and
<a href="http://http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk" target="_blank"
title="Her Majesty&apos;s Courts & Tribunals Service">HMCS</a> (the Courts Service)
publishes some listings, much is still <em>digitally</em> inaccessible,
and what is there is difficult to navigate.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-judgmental">What is Judgmental.org.uk?</h2>

<p><strong>The Judgmental.org.uk project aims to make all United Kingdom law as
accessible and usable as possible</strong>. We focus primarily on case law
(previous judgments), as this is the area most in need of improvement.</p>

<p>By &quot;accessible&quot;, we mean:</p>

<ul>
    <li><i>Present</i>&mdash;as many judgments should be available online as possible.</li>
    <li><i>Searchable</i>&mdash;smart, powerful search is essential for such a large body of documents.</li>
    <li><i>Manageable</i>&mdash;facilities like tagging and grouping also help filter information.</li>
    <li><i>Meaningful</i>&mdash;(a.k.a. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web#Purpose"
        title="Wikipedia entry on semantic technology">semantic</a>); specifically marking things like
        judges' names, times and places makes documents more useful than plain text.</li>
</ul>

<p>We still have a long way to go in this mission, and <a href="/contribute.html"
title="Contribute to Judgmental.org.uk project">you can help</a>!</p>

<h2 id="important-note"><strong>Please note</strong></h2>

<p>Judgmental.org.uk is <em>not finished</em>, and
it is <em>not authoritative</em>.</p>

<p>While some judgment texts are drafts obtained directly from judges,
it's possible that the judgment was delivered differently when read out in
court, so the official record of the judgment would be different.</p>

<p>Further, Judgmental.org.uk is a <a href="/contribute.html"
title="Contribute to the Judgmental.org.uk project">community effort</a>
in its early stages, and the way we manage the judgment documents may change over
time. Particularly, <strong>documents may be tagged, reformatted or otherwise
altered</strong> to achieve the accessibility goals mentioned above.</p>

<p>This means that, while we will do our utmost to make sure the information
on the site is correct and helpful, <strong>you must not use Judgmental.org.uk
as a source of legal advice</strong>. If you have a legal problem, you should
<a href="http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/findasolicitor"
title="Law Society Find a Solicitor site">talk to a solicitor</a>, or find out
about free legal advice in your area as might be offered by the <a
href="http://www.citizensadvice.org.uk">Citizens&apos; Advice Bureau</a>, the
<a href="http://www.thefru.org.uk">Free Representation Unit</a>, or your
regional <a href="http://www.accesstojusticefoundation.org.uk/regional-trusts/"
title="Access to Justice Foundation website">legal support trust</a>. Your
local university law department may also have a legal advice clinic run by
students.

<h2 id="info-source">Where does the information come from?</h2>

<p>In the Summer of 2011, one of our collaborators got a CD in the post
containing thousands of judgments. We have no idea who sent it. For that reason,
it does not get updated. It seems current up until the middle of 2009.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-bailii">Why not just use the BAILII website?</h2>

<p>BAILII&apos;s database has quite a few limitations. For example,
<a href="http://www.bailii.org/robots.txt" target="_blank"
title="bailii.org&apos;s &quot;robots.txt&quot; file">their server
settings</a> prevent the site from being indexed by search engines, which
is how most people find information online. In addition, their own site
search facility isn&apos;t as good as it could be, and there is no facility
for grouping judgments on a topic by tag or cross-referencing.</p>

<p>Judgemental.org.uk on the other hand will be searchable using normal
search engines like Google. This means that ordinary members of the public
who haven't already heard of BAILII will be able to find case law with
normal searches.</p>

<p>But that's just for starters. There are a whole host of ways we could
improve access to UK case law, and <a href="/contribute.html">we want your
ideas too</a>!</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

<p>Vast hoards of case law data are still locked away or only released via
paid-for services. The battle to open up the UK courts continues!

<h2 id="spelling">Why doesn't it have an &apos;e&apos; in it?</h2>

<p>Because at the very start of my very first Trusts seminar our tutor
gave us a stern look and said, &quot;You might leave here not knowing
very much about Trusts Law, but you <em>will</em> learn how to spell the
word &apos;judgment&apos;. There is no &apos;e&apos; in it.&quot;
Apparently, with an &apos;e&apos; is the American spelling. So there you
go.</p>
