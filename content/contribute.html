<h1>Contribute to the Judgmental.org.uk project!</h1>

<p>No matter your background or skills, if you share <a
href="/about.html#what-is-judgmental">our vision for open and accessible
legal information</a> then you can help us achieve it.</p>

<p>Here are some ways you can help:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><i>Spread the word</i>&mdash;we need more people to know about the
    problems with access to UK legal information and how we plan to solve them.
    The more people who know, the more people might want to help!</p></li>

<li><p><i>Tell us what you think</i>&mdash;read about <a href="/about.html">
    our purpose and goals</a>, use the site, and let us know your thoughts by
    <a href="http://twitter.com/judgmentals" target="_blank">tweeting us
    @Judgmentals</a>, or <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/judgmental/"
    target="_blank">posting to our mailing list</a>. We&apos;d be particularly
    interested in hearing from people who aren&apos;t law or techie people like
    us, so we can know if we&apos;re on the right track! Feedback is the breakfast
    of champions, after all.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Help with accessibility</i>&mdash;we&apos;re keen to make sure our site
    design excludes no-one, and we could really use some experienced input in that
    regard.</p></li>

<li><p><i>Help with design</i>&mdash;with all the excitement of HTML5 and semantic
    technologies, it can be hard to make sure the site works well with older
    browsers and systems. We&apos;d be more than happy to share this particular
    burden!</p></li>

<li><p><i><strong>Lots more</strong></i>&mdash;<a
    href="https://github.com/frabcus/judgmental/issues?state=open"
    target="_blank">click here to see our long-standing to-do list</a>, ranging
    from site admin tasks to information architecture issues to ideas for new
    features.</p>

    <p>Please join the discussion on that site on an issue that takes your interest
    (you will have to <a href="https://github.com/signup/free" target="_blank">sign
    up</a> for a free account). Again, your skills background doesn&apos;t matter;
    everyone has something to contribute, even if just your opinions as a user
    (which are crucial, actually!) and we want all of you to be involved.</p>
